# TSP_Problem

This repository contains a C++ implementation for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using brute force.


## Overview

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city. While brute force is not efficient for large numbers of cities, it provides an exact solution for smaller instances.

## Features

- Generation of random nodes with specified bounds for coordinates.
- Computation of the distance matrix based on distance between nodes.
- Brute force algorithm to find the optimal path.
- Output of the shortest path and its total distance.
